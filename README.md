 # The-Grocers-Market

<br>
 
 ## :trophy: Brief introduction about a project:
<br>
An online shopping mart permits a customer to submit online orders for items and/or services from a store that serves both walk- in customers and online customers. The Online Store System presents an online display of all the items they want to sell. This web based application helps customers to choose their daily needs and add products to their shopping cart. Customers provide their complete detail of address and contact so they can get their chosen products at their home. This web application saves lots of time of customers.
<br><br> 
We will be using php/html for the front-end and php MyAdmin for the back-end. The
styling part will be done using CSS while the functionality will be added using JavaScript. We
plan on making it as user-friendly as possible, with preplanned packages and even custom
packages available which user can choose according to his preference.
<br><br>
This system provides a lot of features to manage the products in a very well manner. This system contains a lot of advance modules which makes the back end system very powerful.Online grocery store system provides the searching facilities based on the various factors such that products, customers, payment, categories, stock. It can track all the information products, customers, categories, stock and payment.
 <br><br>
 Today the era has changed completely and the people are not much interested in going to local stores rather they prefer to shop online. This trend has made a revolutionary change in online shopping industry and today every business organization has their own online store. It has become one of the biggest industries in terms of revenue and customers.
<br><br>
The customer can sign in/sign up and search for the tour packages. Customers can book easily through the site. And there are other features such as customers can check their Tour history and their issued tickets, and many more. And Admin can Create, Manage Packages, Manage bookings, issues, inquiries, pages. The design is pretty simple and the user wonâ€™t find it difficult to understand, use and navigate.
